## TOOL USED
**Excel:** For Data Cleaning, Analysis, creating Charts, and Dashboard

## DATA CLEANING
The dataset for this project was gotten from the National Bureau of Statistics website, and it was a full Excel Workbook of the Report, so I had to extract the worksheet I needed and clean it.

+ I unmerged any merged cells to ensure each data point was in its own cell, making it easier to sort and analyze.
+ I updated column headers to better reflect the data in each column, improving clarity and readability for analysis.
+ Irrelevant or empty columns and cells were removed to streamline the dataset and focus only on useful data.
+ I formatted the dataset as an Excel table, which enhanced sorting, filtering, and referencing, making the analysis smoother.
+ The data was organized and formatted consistently to ensure accuracy and reduce potential errors during analysis.
+ This approach made the dataset more structured and ready for analysis.

## PRE ANALYSIS
Before creating the charts, I performed a pre-analysis to gain a deeper understanding of the dataset and guide the storytelling process. This included:

+ **Project Breakdown:** I classified the data into dependent and independent variables, which helped clarify the relationships and potential insights within the dataset.
+ **Generating Key Questions:** Based on the grouped variables, I developed key questions that the dataset could answer, highlighting the insights that could emerge even before visualization.
+ **Early Insights:** Through thoughtful consideration of the questions and data, I uncovered preliminary insights that shaped the direction of the analysis and focused on valuable outcomes.
+ **Storytelling:** With a clear grasp of the dataset, I crafted a narrative by connecting the relationships between data points and the insights gained.
+ **Identifying Industry & Stakeholders:** This process also allowed me to pinpoint the relevant industry, identify key stakeholders, and understand how the findings would define success for the organization.
This approach ensured the analysis was not only insightful but also aligned with the needs of the industry and stakeholders.

## CHART ANALYSIS
Once I was done with my Pre-Analysis, I started creating my charts. Here is the Analysis for each chart.

### States With The Highest Allocation

This chart shows that Delta State stands out as the top recipient of allocations, receiving a hefty sum of ₦44.8 billion. Lagos and Rivers follow closely with ₦38.3 billion and ₦36.2 billion, respectively, making them the next major beneficiaries. Akwa Ibom and Bayelsa also received significant amounts, while Kano and Anambra are noticeably lower on the list, with ₦16.6 billion and ₦13.0 billion. There’s a clear gap between the top five states, many of which are oil-producing, and the rest, which may reflect the influence of revenue-sharing policies tied to economic activities or natural resources. These differences raise important questions about how funds are distributed and whether all regions are being equitably supported.

### States With The Least Allocation

These allocations are crucial for state budgeting and development.

## OBSERVATIONS

+ Delta received the highest allocation at ₦44.8 billion, followed by Lagos at ₦38.2 billion and Rivers at ₦36.2 billion. Akwa Ibom, Bayelsa, Kano, and Anambra also received substantial amounts, showing a strong concentration of funds toward oil-producing states.
+ Cross River received the lowest allocation at ₦8.1 billion, with Ekiti, Gombe, Osun, Kwara, and Ebonyi falling within the ₦8–9 billion range. None of these are oil-producing states, highlighting disparities in fund distribution.
+ Lagos has the highest external debt at ₦6.9 billion, far exceeding Kaduna at ₦3.7 billion and Rivers at ₦3.5 billion. Oyo, Edo, Cross River, and Ogun follow with smaller debts, reflecting varying financial strategies among states.
+ Lagos leads VAT allocations with ₦38.1 billion, followed by Rivers, Kano, Oyo, Kaduna, and Katsina. This reinforces Lagos as Nigeria’s economic hub, contributing significantly to VAT revenue.
+ Delta received the highest 13% derivation allocation at ₦16.9 billion, followed by Akwa Ibom, Rivers, Bayelsa, Edo, and Ondo. These states benefit from oil revenue, which entitles them to additional funds.
+ Kano received the highest ecology allocation at ₦194.8 million, followed by Lagos, Borno, Katsina, and Bauchi. The focus on Northern states suggests priority environmental interventions like desertification control.
+ Ogun received the highest solid minerals allocation at ₦307.5 million, followed by Osun, Kogi, Nasarawa, and Ebonyi, likely due to their mining activities.

## RECOMMENDATIONS

+ States receiving the highest allocations should ensure that these funds are effectively utilized for infrastructure, social services, and economic diversification. Agencies should assess whether these high allocations translate to economic development, improved living standards, and provide clear accountability measures to prevent mismanagement.
+ States with low allocations must strengthen their internally generated revenue (IGR) strategies to reduce reliance on federal allocation. Economic diversification should be encouraged through investments in agriculture, tourism, and industrialization. Agencies should assess whether allocation formulas adequately support these states and consider adjustments to the sharing formula to ensure fair support for states with limited resources. Special intervention funds can also be allocated to foster development.
+ States with high external debts should negotiate or restructure their debts to ease payments and focus on responsible borrowing strategies to prevent financial distress. Budget accountability is necessary to ensure borrowed funds are used for revenue-generating projects rather than expenditures that will not benefit the state. Agencies should improve transparency in loan approvals and offer advisory support to states struggling with debt repayment.
+ VAT distribution should be aligned with each state’s economic activity to encourage tax compliance and business growth. States should implement policies that promote business expansion and attract investment by creating business-friendly environments to increase their VAT revenue. Agencies must ensure VAT deductions are transparent and that states receive their rightful share promptly. Digital monitoring systems can be implemented to enhance accountability.
+ Oil-producing states must use their derivation funds for sustainable economic development rather than consumption-based spending. Investment in infrastructure, education, and alternative industries should be prioritized to prepare for a post-oil economy. States should develop host communities and provide social services for those affected by oil exploration. Agencies should enforce strict monitoring and reporting requirements to prevent fund misallocation and corruption. The sharing formula should also be revised as Akwa Ibom, which produces more oil, received a lower allocation than Delta.
+ Ecology funds should be used to mitigate environmental degradation, especially in states prone to flooding, desertification, and erosion. States receiving these funds must establish clear action plans for disaster management and climate adaptation. Agencies should ensure funds are disbursed based on environmental impact assessments rather than fixed entitlements, taking into consideration the specific environmental challenges each state faces. The 50% given to NDDC and HYPPDEC should be utilized effectively to improve the lives of host communities affected by oil and hydro-power exploration.
+ Revenue from solid minerals should be reinvested into local mining communities to boost economic activities and improve living conditions. States with solid mineral resources should develop policies that attract responsible mining investments while ensuring environmental sustainability. Agencies should enhance revenue collection mechanisms and curb illegal mining to maximize earnings from this sector.
+ Further investigation is needed to clarify why Soku, which is not a state, received an allocation of ₦588 million. Understanding why this happened will help improve transparency in revenue distribution and increase public trust. States must actively monitor and renegotiate unfavorable financial obligations where necessary to avoid excessive burdens. Agencies should standardize deduction policies to prevent unnecessary financial strain on states.
+ A more balanced and transparent revenue allocation system is crucial for national development. States must enhance financial discipline, improve revenue generation, and ensure efficient fund utilization, while agencies must enforce accountability and fairness in allocation distribution. A collaborative approach between federal institutions and state governments is essential for long-term economic stability and growth.
 

## CONCLUSION

This project provided a data-driven analysis of Nigeria’s FAAC allocation system, highlighting the structural and economic factors that influence revenue distribution among states. Through detailed examination of statutory allocations, VAT contributions, derivation funds, ecological and mineral revenues, as well as debt deductions, the analysis revealed key disparities and dependencies within the system.

The insights generated from this study can support better fiscal planning, inform policy discussions, and promote transparency in public finance. It also underscores the importance of data in understanding governance and guiding equitable development strategies.
